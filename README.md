### About Me

I am an MSc-qualified R&D and Mechanical Engineer specializing in FEA simulation (ANSYS, Abaqus) and complex CAD design.

Following my academic and R&D career, I relocated to the UK. My immediate priority was to gain practical, hands-on industry experience within the UK market and perfect my business-level English.

To achieve this, I took on Field Engineering and client-facing roles. This phase provided me with an invaluable understanding of how systems are commissioned, installed, and perform in real-world environments.

I am now focused on applying this unique combination of deep analytical skills and practical field experience to my core career in R&D and Mechanical Engineering.

## Project 1: R&D / CFD Simulation (ANSYS)
### Project: Increasing the Strength of Extruder Parts by Spraying (MSc Thesis)

**Objective:** To analyze and predict the mechanical erosion (abrasive wear) of extruder screws caused by various abrasive fillers and to prove the effectiveness of chrome-spraying.

**Methodology:** Developed an advanced numerical model (CFD) using **ANSYS** with the **Discrete Phase Model (DPM)** to simulate and map wear patterns.

**Key Findings:**
* Successfully mapped erosion patterns for fillers like glass fibre and graphite.
* **Proved that chrome-spraying increased component service life by up to 232%** when processing graphite-filled polymers.

## Project 2: FEA / Abrasive Wear Simulation (Abaqus)
### Project: Research on the Wear Process of the Extruder Screw (BSc Thesis)

**Objective:** To develop a predictive model using **Abaqus (FEA)** to calculate the abrasive wear and total service life of an extruder screw.

**Methodology:** Conducted an FEA simulation of a single quartz particle scratching the steel surface (Steel 38KhMYuA) to determine reaction forces and Von Mises stress.

**Key Findings:**
* Successfully simulated the stress and deformation caused by a single abrasive particle.
* Extrapolated the simulation data to calculate a total component lifespan of **T = 5000 hours**.

### PROJECT 3: Engineering Automation (AutoLISP)
### Project: Parametric Shaft Design & Validation Tool (Academic R&D)

**Objective:** To automate and error-proof the creation of technical shaft drawings, a common and repetitive task in mechanical design. (Ref: *Coursework, KPI*)

**Methodology:** Developed a program entirely in **AutoLISP** for AutoCAD. The tool prompts the user for key parameters (diameters, lengths, etc.) and performs validation checks to ensure the inputs are logical and manufacturable.

**Result:** An automation script that instantly generates a complete, validated technical drawing. This tool drastically reduces design time (from hours to minutes) and eliminates the risk of human error in data entry.
*(Note: Project contains flowcharts for Program Algorithm and Input Data Validation).*

## Project 4: Mechanical CAD Design (SOLIDWORKS)
### Project: Retail POS Display & Industrial Machinery Design (Design Bureau Experience)

**Objective:** To design complex, multi-part assemblies for commercial and industrial use, focusing on Design for Manufacture (DFM).

**Methodology:** Used **SOLIDWORKS** and **AutoCAD** to create detailed 3D models, production-ready manufacturing drawings, and exploded-view assemblies.
